\section{Recent developments}
    \Abinitio{} studies for the ${\rm O_2 - O_2}$ system are computationally difficult due to the open shell nature of the monomer $\rm{O_2}$ which prevents the orthogonalization of the monomer wavefunctions \cite{Bussery1993}. Recently it is gaining popularity in the field of buffer gas cooling and trapping of oxygen \cite{Friedrich1998,Avdeenkov2001}. Since the ground state monomer exists in the triplet state, there are three possible molecular spin states (denoted as singlet, triplet and quintet) and associated PESs. The short-range exchange interactions were known to cause not only repulsion but also splitting between the molecular spin states of the dimer. Computationally expensive short-range exchange calculations using the Heisenberg Hamiltonian were first performed by van Hemert et al. \cite{vanHemert1983} in a preliminary study and later by Wormer and van der Avoird \cite{Wormer1984}. The authors reported \abinitio{} calculations including electrostatic as well as exchange interactions but excluding long range dispersion interactions as they were primarily interested in studying the solid phase magnetic properties of the dimer. They reported PESs for the three different spin states using spherical expansion to represent the orientational dependence and exponential functions to represent the dependence on intermolecular distance.  By including first order electrostatic and exchange contributions \abinitio{}, second order polarization energy semi-empirically, Bussery and Wormer \cite{Bussery1993} reported improved PESs for the oxygen dimer and used it mainly for studying optical properties. By accounting for dipole-dipole as well as multipole-multipole contributions, they were able to accurately capture the intermolecular correlation energy. The simple analytic form of the polarization energy helped improve their overall computational efficiency as well. The gas phase second virial coefficients computed using the different PESs were found to be in very good statistical agreement with experiments. Really precise molecular beam experiments were performed by Aquilanti et al. \cite{Aquilanti1999} to obtain anisotropic PESs using a spherical harmonics expansion but including only four terms. This led to a simplified potential model with less number of fitted parameters. Upon comparison with the \abinitio{} calculations of Bussery et al. \cite{Bussery1993}, they found good agreement for various geometrical predictions related to the dimer structure. Hern√°ndez-Lamoneda et al. \cite{Lamoneda2005CPL} in a preliminary study and later Bartolomei et al. \cite{Bartolomei2008} performed really accurate \abinitio{} calculations at RCCSD(T) level of theory for the quintet state of the oxygen dimer. This was possible only for the quintet state because of the acceptable nature of a single configuration reference as the zeroth-order function. Such highly accurate calculations are not possible for the singlet and triplet states. However, MRCI calculations, albeit with size inconsistency issues can still be applied to study these states. By accurately extracting the spin-coupling parameter $J$ involved in the Heisenberg Hamiltonian within the MRCI calculations and combining it with accurate spin-averaged interaction potential from the RCCSD(T) calculations, they were able to obtain high quality PESs than previous studies. Zuchowski \cite{Zuchowski2008} performed SAPT based DFT calculations for the quintet state and observed very good agreement with previous accurate \abinitio{} coupled-cluster calculations. More recently Bartolomei et al. \cite{Bartolomei2010} have obtained completely \abinitio{} PESs for the three spin states by combining their previous RCCSD(T) data \cite{Bartolomei2008} for the quintet state with new \abinitio{} calculations at the CASPT2 and MRCI levels of theory for the singlet and triplet states. By including dynamical electron correlation at higher levels of theory than previous calculations, they were able to improve the accuracy of the PESs. They observed very good agreement with experiments for their second virial coefficients as well as integral cross sections.
\section{Computational details}
    The \abinitio{} potentials for the different spin multiplicities (s = 0, 1 and 2) and using different levels of theory i.e. MRCI and PT2 were due to Bartolomei et al. \cite{Bartolomei2010}. As we can see, we have 6 different potential surfaces that were reported. The full dimer virial coefficients are obtained for each level of theory by combining the individual spin virial coefficient value according to the formula \cite{Aquilanti1999,Bartolomei2010}:
    \begin{equation}
        B_2 = \frac{B_2^0 + 3 B_2^1 + 5 B_2^2}{9}.
    \end{equation}
    where $B_2^s$ represents the second virial coefficient value computed using the appropriate potential based on the level of theory and the spin multiplicity $s$.

    We have performed classical and PIMC virial coefficient simulations at both levels of theory, all the spin multiplicities and set of 15 temperatures reported. For each type of classical simulation, we have collected $10^8$ configuration samples that were generated using two types of MC trials 1) translation and 2) rotation of the dimer. The PIMC simulations involved $P$ = 8, 16, 32 and 64 images for each condition mentioned above and we collected $10^7$ configuration samples per PIMC simulation. Apart from the translation of the dimer, we also include MC trials to regrow the ring by translating the beads (see Sec. \ref{subsec:orMove}) and our recently developed orientation algorithm (cite:hydrogen) (explained in Sec. \ref{subsec:orMove}).

    To avoid unphysical values of the intermolecular energy for oxygen dimers, an artificial hard core with a diameter of 4.5 Bohr was used in all virial coefficient calculations. All the oxygen MSMC simulations involved a Hard Sphere reference with a diameter of 4.5 \AA.
\section{Results and discussion}
    We have computed classical as well as quantum virial coefficients using PIMC with $P$ = 8, 16, 32 and 64 images for both the MRCI and the PT2 PESs. In general, our classical and PIMC results agree well with those of Bartolomei et al. \cite{Bartolomei2010} for the, albeit small range of, temperatures considered. In Fig. \ref{fig:B2O2AllDiffMRCI} we plot the difference between various second virial coefficient values and our most accurate PIMC results ($P$ = 64), for the MRCI PESs, as a function of temperature. It should be noted that the range of the $y$-axis was chosen to highlight the differences over the whole range of temperatures considered and as a result we did not include some data points (whose $B_2$ value was lesser than -5 cm$^3$ mol$^{-1}$), especially for low temperatures.

    From Fig. \ref{fig:B2O2AllDiffMRCI}, it can be seen that the semi-classical MRCI calculations performed by Bartolomei et al. \cite{Bartolomei2010} agrees with our PIMC calculations for the same PESs, better than other semi-classical or classical calculations. Additionally, our PIMC calculations have converged for almost all temperatures investigated. Also, the experimental and the SC-Perugia values deviate the largest. For SC-Perugia calculations, this can be explained by the fact that their values are outdated and also because the use of different PESs than ours. Finally, we can see that our classical values start to deviate significantly from the PIMC results for temperatures $T \le 200K$.

    From Fig. \ref{fig:B2O2AllDiffPT2}, we observe a trend very similar to that of Fig. \ref{fig:B2O2AllDiffMRCI}. Here too, it can be seen that the semi-classical PT2 calculations performed by Bartolomei et al. \cite{Bartolomei2010} agrees with our PIMC calculations for the same PESs, better than other semi-classical or classical calculations. Our PIMC calculations have converged for all temperatures investigated. Also, the experimental and the SC-Perugia values deviate the largest. For SC-Perugia calculations, this can be explained by the fact that their values are outdated and also because the use of different PESs than ours. Finally, we can see that our classical values start to deviate significantly from the PIMC results for temperatures $T \le 300K$.

    \section{Conclusions}
        We have calculated fully quantum second virial coefficients for the oxygen dimer based on recent \abinitio{} \PESs due to Bartolomei et al. \cite{Bartolomei2010}. We have implemented our orientation sampling algorithm in PIMC calculations. We observed good agreement with most accurate semi-classical values available in literature. These results add further confidence on the capabilities of the algorithm in combination wtih PIMC to predict accurate quantum virial coefficients.
