% Annotation:

The authors present their Strategic Bias  of Politician-Press-Public
Interactions. The media is a strategic actor in the way that they report
stories; they want proactive coverage that will get rating, while still
maintaining a series of balanced coverage norms. Certain types of news are
over-represented; politicians desire to report balanced (both parties),
novel, and an unexpected information from authoritative sources, such as
politicians. This leads to over-sampled Presidential Party (PP) criticism by
his own party. Moreover, when a crisis is highly salient PP criticism will
have a higher probability of making it onto news stories. New news media
consists of niche outlets which are outright partisan (especially bloggs);
partisan news outlets are likely to report news that will hurt the opposite
party and help their own, while traditional news outlets (New York Time, CBS
News, etc.) are more likely to broadcast both types of news (making them more
balanced). Statements from one's own party will be more credible than
statements from the opposing party, because messengers with similar interests
are more credible than those with dissimilar interests. Another source of
credibility is the cost of the message; messages that attack one's own party
are more costly than those that attack the opposing party and thus more
credible. The authors predict that positive evaluations by Non-Presidential
Party (NPP) elites and negative evaluations by PP elites will have the
highest impact on presidential among partisan identifiers. Also, the
proportion of credible praise to credible criticism in the media will be
greater in divided rather than unified government, and the opposite is also
true. This leads to the prediction that during divided government the
president will receive greater public support in times of foreign policy
crisis during divided government than during unified government. During the
rally period negative criticism from both the PP and the NPP will have a
greater affect on Presidential Approval, because they are more costly during
this period of time; consequently , positive praise from NPP elites will be
discounted during this stage because they are less costly to make during the
rally period. %
