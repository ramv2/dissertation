%
% This is a template file to help get you started using the
% psuthesis.cls for theses and dissertations at Penn State
% University. You will, of course, need to put the
% psuthesis.cls file someplace that LaTeX will find it.
%
% We have set up a directory structure that we find to be clean
% and convenient. You can readjust it to suit your tastes. In
% fact, the structure used by our students is even a little
% more involved and commands are defined to point to the
% various directories.
%
% This document has been set up to be typeset using pdflatex.
% About the only thing you will need to change if typesetting
% using latex is the \DeclareGraphicsExtensions command.
%
% The psuthesis document class uses the same options as the
% book class. In addition, it requires that you have the
% ifthen, calc, setspace, and tocloft packages.
%
% The first additional option specifies the degree type. You
% can choose from:
%     Ph.D. using class option <phd>
%     M.S. using class option <ms>
%     M.Eng. using class option <meng>
%     M.A. using class option <ma>
%     B.S. using class option <bs>
%     B.A. using class option <ba>
%     Honors Baccalaureate using the option <honors>
%
% If you specify either ba or bs in addition to honors, it will
% just use the honors option and ignore the ba or bs option.
%
% The second additional option <inlinechaptertoc> determines
% the formatting of the Chapter entries in the Table of
% Contents. The default sets them as two-line entries (try it).
% If you want them as one-line entries, issue the
% inlinechaptertoc option.
%
% The class option ``honors'' should be used for theses
% submitted to the Schreyer Honors College. This option
% changes the formatting on the Title page so that the
% signatures appear on the Title page. Be sure and comment
% out the command \psusigpage when using this option since it
% is not needed and it messes up the vertical spacing on the
% Title page.
%
% The class option ``honorsdepthead'' adds the signature of the
% department head on the Title page for those baccalaureate
% theses that require this.
%
% The class option ``secondthesissupervisor'' should be used
% for baccalaureate honors degrees if you have a second
% Thesis Supervisor.
%
% The vita is only included with the phd option and it is
% placed at the end of the thesis. The permissions page is only
% included with the ms, meng, and ma options.
